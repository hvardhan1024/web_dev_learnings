# Web Development Learnings

Welcome to the "web_dev_learnings" repository! This is where I document my journey of learning web development, including notes from crash courses, tutorials, and any other valuable insights I gather along the way.

## Introduction
This repository serves as my personal knowledge hub for web development. The goal is to keep track of my progress and create a reference for myself and others interested in web development.

## Courses
In this repository, you'll find the web development crash courses and tutorials I've completed or currently studying. Each course is documented in its own subdirectory within the "courses" folder, containing notes, code snippets, and any additional resources.

## Notes
In the "notes" directory, you'll find detailed markdown files where I jot down key takeaways, tips, and tricks from the web development courses I've completed. These notes are organized by course, making it easy to access specific information.

Feel free to explore these notes and use them as a quick reference or study aid.

Happy coding and learning!
