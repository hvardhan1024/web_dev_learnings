# JavaScript Prototypes

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it uses prototypes to handle object inheritance. Here are some key points about prototypes:

- **Prototype Chain**: Every JavaScript object has a prototype, and these objects form a prototype chain. Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.

- **Constructor Functions**: Constructor functions are used to create objects that share a common prototype. Objects created with the same constructor inherit properties and methods from that constructor's prototype.

- **Prototype Property**: The `prototype` property is a property of constructor functions. It's an object that becomes the prototype for all objects created with that constructor.

- **`__proto__`**: Each object has a hidden `__proto__` property that points to its prototype. It allows objects to access properties and methods from their prototype.

- **Inheritance**: If an object doesn't have a specific property or method, JavaScript will look up the prototype chain until it finds it. This mechanism enables inheritance.

- **Modifying Prototypes**: You can add properties and methods to an object's prototype, and all objects created from that constructor will inherit those changes.

- **`Object.create()`: This method creates a new object with the specified prototype. It's a way to set up inheritance explicitly.

Understanding prototypes is fundamental to working with JavaScript and creating efficient, reusable code.
