# What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that structures code based on the concept of "objects." In OOP, software is designed and organized around these objects, which are instances of classes. Each object can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions) associated with it.

## Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is another programming paradigm where code is structured around procedures or functions. In procedural programming, functions take input, perform operations, and return output. The focus is on the sequence of actions and data flow.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions. In functional programming, functions don't have side effects and don't mutate external data. Instead, they operate on data and return new data, promoting immutability and predictability.

# Why OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming provides several advantages:

- **Abstraction**: OOP allows you to abstract complex real-world concepts into code. You can model real-world objects as classes, making the code more intuitive and closer to human thought processes.

- **Modularity**: OOP promotes modularity by breaking down code into smaller components (objects). This makes it easier to manage and maintain complex systems.

# Examples of OOP

Examples of OOP languages include:

- **Java**: An object-oriented language known for its platform independence and strong typing.

- **Python**: A versatile language that supports OOP and is known for its simplicity and readability.

- **C++**: An extension of the C language that includes OOP features, making it suitable for both procedural and object-oriented programming.

- **C#**: Developed by Microsoft, C# is an OOP language used for building Windows applications and game development.

These languages utilize OOP concepts to structure code around objects and classes, making it easier to design, develop, and maintain software.
