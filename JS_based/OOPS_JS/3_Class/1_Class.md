# JavaScript Classes

JavaScript introduced the `class` keyword in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to create class-based object-oriented programming structures. Here are some key points about JavaScript classes:

- **Class Declaration**: The `class` keyword is used to declare a class. Classes are templates for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

- **Constructor Method**: The `constructor` method is a special method that gets called when an object is created from a class. It initializes object properties.

- **Methods**: You can define methods within a class to define its behavior. These methods are shared by all instances created from the class.

- **Inheritance**: Classes can extend other classes, forming a hierarchy. The `extends` keyword is used to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

- **Constructor Super**: In a subclass, you can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of the parent class, allowing you to set up properties inherited from the parent.

- **Static Methods**: You can define static methods using the `static` keyword. These methods are associated with the class itself, not instances.

- **Getters and Setters**: Classes support getter and setter methods, allowing controlled access to object properties.

JavaScript classes provide a more structured and organized way to work with objects, making code easier to read and maintain.
